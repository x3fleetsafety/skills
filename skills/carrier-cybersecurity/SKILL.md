# Carrier Cybersecurity

Trucking companies handle valuable data (ELD logs, shipper contracts, customer payment info, driver PII) and increasingly are targets for ransomware + data theft. This skill covers practical cybersecurity for motor carriers.

## What attackers want

| Asset | Why valuable |
|---|---|
| **Customer payment info + bank routing** | Direct fraud (BEC schemes) |
| **Driver PII (SSN, CDL)** | Identity theft / synthetic identity |
| **ELD + Telematics data** | Competitive intelligence; insurance fraud |
| **Customer contracts + rates** | Competitive intelligence |
| **Operational systems** | Ransomware (pay to restore) |
| **Driver health / medical records** | HIPAA-protected data |
| **EDI credentials** | Hijack billing or order systems |

## Common attacks against carriers

### Business Email Compromise (BEC)
- Attacker spoofs CEO email
- Asks accounting to wire money to "new" vendor account
- Common loss: $50K-$500K per incident
- Defense: 2FA on email, verbal verification of wires, BEC training

### Ransomware
- Malware encrypts your systems
- Attacker demands payment in crypto to restore
- Common loss: $50K-$1M in ransom + recovery costs
- Defense: backups, employee training, network segmentation

### Phishing / spear-phishing
- Email pretends to be from a customer / vendor / IT
- Asks for credentials or to click malicious link
- Common loss: data theft, credential compromise
- Defense: email filtering, training, 2FA

### Telematics + ELD intrusion
- Attacker accesses your telematics system
- Steals operational data; potentially manipulates GPS or vehicle controls
- Less common but emerging risk
- Defense: vendor-vetted telematics, security patches, segregated networks

### Supply chain / vendor compromise
- Attacker breaches your software vendor (e.g., ELD provider)
- Gains access through that pathway
- Defense: vendor security assessment, separate accounts

## Foundational cybersecurity (minimum)

For any small-mid carrier:

### 1. Strong passwords + 2FA
- Min 12 character passwords
- Different password per system
- 2FA on email, banking, telematics
- Password manager for staff (1Password, Bitwarden)

### 2. Email security
- SPF, DKIM, DMARC configured for your domain
- Phishing email filter
- Train staff to recognize phishing (especially BEC)
- 2FA on email

### 3. Endpoint security
- Antivirus on all computers
- Patching schedule (weekly minimum)
- Encrypted hard drives on laptops
- No personal devices for business email/data

### 4. Network security
- WiFi password-protected
- Guest WiFi separate from operations WiFi
- VPN for remote access
- Firewall + intrusion detection (if affordable)

### 5. Backups
- Daily backups of critical systems
- One backup off-site (cloud)
- One backup offline (cold storage / air-gapped)
- Test backup restore quarterly

### 6. Incident response plan
- Written plan for ransomware, BEC, data breach
- Designated incident commander
- Pre-arranged forensic + insurance contacts

## Specific to trucking systems

### ELD security
- Confirm your ELD provider has FMCSA-required security
- Patch your ELD devices when updates available
- Don't reuse passwords across ELD + other systems
- Verify GPS data isn't transmitted in plaintext

### Customer EDI
- Use TLS encryption for EDI transmissions
- Test EDI partner authentication
- Monitor for unusual transactions
- Maintain audit log

### Fleet telematics
- Same as ELD; vendor security matters
- Don't share telematics login across staff
- 2FA where supported

### Driver mobile apps (if used)
- Use vendor-vetted apps (Samsara, Motive, etc.)
- Limit data access to need-to-know
- Driver passwords + 2FA
- App revocation when driver leaves

## Compliance requirements

While there's no FMCSA-mandated cybersecurity standard, related rules:

- **49 CFR 391** — Driver Qualification File contains PII; must be secured
- **HIPAA** — if you handle driver medical records, you're a covered entity
- **State data breach laws** — typically require notification of affected individuals
- **PCI DSS** — if you handle credit card payments
- **GDPR / CCPA** — if you have EU or California customers

## Common cyber-incident response

When something happens:

### First 1 hour
1. **Disconnect** affected systems from network (don't shut down — preserves forensic evidence)
2. **Notify** designated incident commander
3. **Engage** forensic vendor (pre-arranged)
4. **Notify** law enforcement if criminal activity suspected

### First 24 hours
1. **Assessment** — what systems compromised? what data accessed?
2. **Notify** insurance carrier (cyber insurance, if you have it)
3. **Identify** business continuity options (manual processes)
4. **Communicate** internally (designated spokesperson)

### First week
1. **Eradicate** the threat (forensic team cleans systems)
2. **Restore** from clean backups
3. **Notify** affected customers / drivers (if data accessed)
4. **Engage** external counsel for legal exposure

### First 30 days
1. **Detailed forensic report**
2. **Insurance claim**
3. **Regulatory notifications** (if required)
4. **Lessons learned** review
5. **Strengthen controls** based on root cause

## Cyber insurance

A separate policy specifically for cyber:

- **Coverage**: ransomware payments, forensic costs, legal fees, business interruption, third-party claims (customer data breach)
- **Cost**: $1K-$15K per year for typical small-mid carrier
- **Limits**: $250K-$5M typical
- **Required by**: increasingly, by larger shippers + brokers as contract requirement

If you don't have cyber insurance + you experience a serious cyber incident: you may not survive financially.

## Vendor + supply chain security

When evaluating ELD, telematics, or payroll vendors:

- **SOC 2 Type II certification?** — annual third-party audit
- **HIPAA-compliant?** — if you store health data
- **Data residency?** — US-based servers
- **Access controls?** — role-based access for staff
- **Incident response plan?** — they have one when something goes wrong
- **Insurance?** — vendor has cyber insurance covering you

Major vendors (Samsara, Motive, Geotab, ADP, McLeod) generally have strong security; smaller vendors variable.

## Common cyber mistakes

1. **One password across everything.** Compromise of one = compromise of all.
2. **No 2FA on email + financial systems.**
3. **No backups (or backups stored on same network as primary).**
4. **No incident response plan** — chaos when something happens.
5. **Open WiFi for ops** — anyone in parking lot accesses systems.
6. **Cloud backup credentials = same as email.**
7. **Staff falling for BEC scam** — pays fraudulent vendor invoice.
8. **No cyber insurance** — single incident = bankruptcy.

## Building cybersecurity culture

Small to mid-size carriers can:

1. Run annual cybersecurity training for all staff (15-30 min)
2. Send simulated phishing emails quarterly (tracking who falls for it)
3. Have a written policy on password security
4. Designated IT contact (internal or vendor)
5. Annual review of vendor security
6. Annual review of insurance coverage

Cost: $5K-$15K annually for a 25-truck fleet. Saves potentially $50K+ in single incident.

## Where this fits in X3

X3 doesn't currently provide cybersecurity tools or services. For customers asking about this:

- Use a vendor with strong security (X3, Samsara, McLeod, etc.)
- Implement 2FA on all critical systems
- Get cyber insurance
- Build incident response plan
- Run annual security training

X3's role: maintaining strong security on its own platform (SOC 2 commitment, encryption, RLS) so customer data is protected.
