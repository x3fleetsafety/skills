# Why There Is No Real-Time CSA Score Relay

A common question: "Why doesn't [vendor] show real-time CSA scores?" Answer: FMCSA doesn't publish them that way. Period.

## SAFER refresh cycle
FMCSA recalculates and republishes SMS data monthly, typically around the 15th of each month:
- Inspections from past 24 months
- Crashes from past 24 months
- Peer group reassignments
- BASIC percentile recalculation
- Public display update

There is NO real-time API. Vendor "real-time CSA" claims are either:
1. Reading the same monthly SAFER feed
2. Estimating based on individual inspection events (predictive, not actual)
3. Pure marketing

## What IS available faster than monthly
- **Individual inspection results** — appear in FMCSA database within 1-3 business days of inspection
- **Crash reports** — within 5-10 business days
- **Carrier operating status changes** — same day

These individual events are not your "CSA score" — they're the data feeding into your eventual recalculation.

## What Compass does
- Pulls your individual inspection + crash data daily (within 1-3 business days of FMCSA recording)
- Estimates score trajectory using current methodology
- Refreshes your official BASIC scores monthly when SAFER updates
- Alerts you when an inspection arrives with violations that may push you into alert

## What Compass does NOT do
- Claim real-time CSA scores
- Pretend to have advance knowledge of FMCSA recalculations
- Sell "predictive CSA" as if it's the same as actual scores

## Honest customer messaging
"FMCSA publishes CSA monthly via SAFER. We pull the moment it refreshes (~15th of each month) and surface your delta. Between refreshes, we track inspections + crashes that will affect your next recalculation, so you have 4-6 weeks of warning instead of finding out the day FMCSA publishes."

## Why this matters for sales conversations
Prospects ask "do you do real-time CSA?" Wrong answer: "yes!" (deceptive). Right answer: "FMCSA doesn't publish real-time CSA — no one has it. We pull the monthly refresh and show you the delta plus the in-flight inspections that will affect your next recalculation." This positions Compass as honest + transparent vs. competitors making false claims.
