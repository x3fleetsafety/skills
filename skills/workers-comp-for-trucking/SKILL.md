# Workers Compensation for Trucking

Workers comp (WC) is state-mandated insurance covering employee on-the-job injuries. For trucking, WC has specific challenges + opportunities.

## What WC covers

For an injured employee:
- **Medical costs** — treatment, surgery, rehabilitation
- **Wage replacement** — typically 66-2/3% of pre-injury wages
- **Disability benefits** — temporary or permanent
- **Death benefits** to dependents (if fatal)
- **Vocational rehabilitation** if returning to work in different role

What WC does NOT cover:
- Pain + suffering
- Punitive damages
- Injuries on personal time
- Self-inflicted injuries
- Drug/alcohol-related injuries (sometimes)

## State-by-state variation

Each state has its own WC law:
- **Premium calculation** varies
- **Coverage limits** vary
- **Filing procedures** vary
- **Independent contractor rules** vary (huge issue for trucking)

Common state classifications:
- **TX** — opt-out is allowed (carrier can decline WC, but exposes to negligence lawsuits)
- **WA, ND, WY, OH** — state-run WC fund (must use state)
- **Most states** — competitive market (multiple carriers compete)

## Trucking-specific WC classifications (NCCI codes)

NCCI (National Council on Compensation Insurance) sets classification codes used in most states:

| Code | Class | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **7228** | Trucking — local hauling | Local + intrastate freight |
| **7229** | Trucking — long-distance | Interstate / OTR |
| **7230** | Trucking — drivers, fleet service | Driver + service operations |
| **7231** | Trucking — household goods | HHG movers |
| **7232** | Trucking — explosives transport | Hazmat / explosive carriers |
| **7233** | Trucking — gasoline + petroleum | Tanker / fuel haulers |
| **7234** | Trucking — sand + gravel | Aggregate / heavy haul |
| **7235** | Trucking — refrigerated | Reefer operations |
| **7236** | Trucking — auto haulers | Vehicle transport |
| **7237** | Trucking — concrete + cement | Mixer trucks |
| **7238** | Trucking — log hauling | Forestry |

Higher-risk classifications (explosives, fuel, logging) have higher rates.

## Premium calculation

```
Premium = (Annual Payroll / $100) × Rate × Experience Modifier (EMR)
```

Where:
- **Annual Payroll** — total W-2 wages for covered employees
- **Rate** — NCCI-set rate per $100 of payroll, per classification
- **Experience Modifier (EMR)** — your fleet's loss history vs industry average

Typical rate for code 7229 (long-distance trucking): $5-12 per $100 payroll, depending on state.

For a 25-truck fleet, $50K/year per driver average payroll = $1.25M total payroll:
- Pure rate: 25 × $50K / $100 × $8 = $100K WC premium
- With EMR 1.0: $100K
- With EMR 0.85 (better than average): $85K
- With EMR 1.25 (worse than average): $125K

## Experience Modifier Rating (EMR)

The EMR is a multiplier reflecting your past 3-5 years of WC claim experience:

- **EMR < 1.0** — better than industry average (cheaper)
- **EMR = 1.0** — industry average
- **EMR > 1.0** — worse than industry average (more expensive)
- **EMR > 1.25** — significantly worse; some shippers won't hire you (Walmart, UPS, large insurance customers require EMR < 1.0 sometimes)

Your EMR rolls 3-5 years. So a serious claim today impacts premiums for several years.

## Common trucking WC claims

Top claim types by frequency:

| Type | Cause | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Slips, trips, falls | Wet docks, ladders, frosty fuel islands | Low-moderate |
| Strains + sprains | Improper lifting, securement tightening | Moderate |
| Vehicle accidents | While on duty | High |
| Cargo handling injuries | Loading/unloading, falling cargo | Moderate-high |
| Heart attack / heart disease | Sedentary lifestyle + stress | Severe |
| Sleep apnea-related crashes | Fatigue | Catastrophic |
| Cumulative trauma | Back, knee, shoulder from years of driving | High but slow-developing |

## Premium reduction strategies

To reduce WC premiums:

### 1. Reduce claim frequency
- Driver wellness programs (see wellness skill)
- Ergonomic improvements (back support, lift training)
- Fatigue management
- Safety culture

### 2. Reduce claim severity
- Fast return-to-work programs (light duty)
- Effective case management
- Quick medical intervention (don't let issues linger)
- Modified work assignments

### 3. Get a lower classification
- If you operate primarily local (7228) vs long-distance (7229)
- If you can split your fleet into different classifications

### 4. Improve EMR
- Manage existing claims aggressively
- Dispute questionable claims
- Use "experience modifier mitigation" services (sometimes available)

### 5. Use a Captive or Self-Insurance
- For larger fleets (200+ trucks)
- Self-fund + buy excess coverage
- Reduces overall cost but increases administration

## Workers comp vs Occupational Accident insurance (for owner-operators)

For owner-operators (1099):

**Workers comp** typically NOT required for ICs (depends on state).

**Occupational Accident Insurance (OAI)** is a substitute:
- Owner-operator pays own premium ($30-50/month typical)
- Covers personal injury during business operations
- Doesn't include employer coverage features
- More limited than WC

Some states REQUIRE OAI for owner-operators leased to a carrier. Most carriers require OAI from their contracted ICs.

## Returning injured drivers to work

Best practice for injury claims:

1. **Immediate medical care** — don't delay
2. **Stay-in-contact program** — call driver weekly during recovery
3. **Light duty / modified work** — bring driver back to office work, light truck, training role
4. **Return-to-work coordinator** — designated staff position
5. **Document the return** — paperwork showing restricted duty

Drivers who return to modified work cost the WC system significantly less than drivers who stay out fully:
- TTD (Temporary Total Disability) payments stop sooner
- Driver maintains skills + identity
- Lower likelihood of permanent disability
- Faster total return to full duty

## Common WC mistakes

1. **Mis-classifying drivers** — treating local drivers as 7229 (long-distance) raises premiums unnecessarily.
2. **Not reporting injury within 24 hours** — some states have penalty for late reporting.
3. **Ignoring minor injuries** — small claim becomes large because not treated.
4. **No return-to-work plan** — driver stays out, claim costs accumulate.
5. **Disputing every claim** — frivolous disputes anger drivers + don't save money.
6. **Not understanding EMR impact** — short-term claim cost ≠ long-term premium impact.
7. **Treating owner-operators as employees** for WC purposes — mis-classification + state penalty.

## Drug-free workplace + WC

Most states reduce WC benefits if injury occurred while driver was:
- Under influence of drugs/alcohol
- Refusing post-accident drug test
- In violation of company drug policy

But the burden is on the carrier to prove. Documentation matters.

## Where this fits in X3

X3's `incidents.html` tracks injury claims. The Risk Index includes WC-related signals (driver health, ergonomic risk factors). Future: integration with WC carriers for claim status tracking.

For a customer asking about WC:
1. What's your current EMR?
2. What's your claim frequency vs severity profile?
3. What's your return-to-work program?
4. What's your driver wellness investment?

Most carriers with strong safety culture + wellness programs have EMR < 1.0, which is a significant competitive advantage.
