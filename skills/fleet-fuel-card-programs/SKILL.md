# Fleet Fuel Card Programs

A fuel card is the operating layer for every motor carrier. It controls fuel purchases, captures IFTA data, enforces driver limits, prevents fraud, and provides discounts at major truck stops.

## Major vendors

| Card | Network strength | Discount range | Fee structure |
|---|---|---|---|
| Comdata | Largest national network, all major stops | $0.04–$0.10/gal off cash | Monthly card fee + per-transaction |
| EFS (WEX-owned) | TA/Petro strong, also Pilot/Love's | $0.04–$0.08/gal | Subscription + transaction |
| WEX | All Loyal + Pilot/Love's | $0.03–$0.07/gal | Per-transaction |
| RTS Financial | Bundles with factoring | $0.04–$0.06/gal | Often free with factoring |
| Pilot Flying J My Rewards | Pilot/Flying J only | $0.04–$0.06/gal | Free |
| Love's Connect | Love's only | $0.04–$0.06/gal | Free |
| OTR Solutions | Bundles factoring + fuel | Varies | Bundled |

Most fleets use **Comdata or EFS** as primary and supplement with **Pilot/Love's branded** at preferred stops to layer discounts.

## Discount mechanics

Truck stops display two prices: **cash retail** and **cash discount**. The fuel-card discount applies to cash discount (NOT pump price). At Pilot/Flying J:

- Pump price: $3.95
- Cash discount: $3.85
- Loyalty discount: -$0.02
- Card discount: -$0.06
- **Final price: $3.77**

A driver buying 150 gallons saves $0.18 × 150 = $27 per fill vs cash retail at the pump.

## Driver authorization controls

Cards can be locked to:
- Specific driver (PIN required)
- Specific truck (VIN matched at pump)
- Specific stops (whitelist by chain or location)
- Time windows (no fuel purchases 11 PM–4 AM, etc.)
- Gallon limits per fill (prevents fueling unauthorized trucks)
- Dollar limits per day / week
- Product restrictions (diesel only — no cash advance, no merchandise)

These controls cut fraud rates by 80–90%. A single fraudulent fill (driver fills personal vehicle, sells gallons to other trucks, etc.) can be $400–$800.

## IFTA data capture

Every fuel transaction is captured with:
- State of purchase
- Gallons
- Price
- Date / time
- Card / driver / truck

This feeds **IFTA quarterly reporting** directly — no manual receipt entry. Most carriers connect fuel-card data to their TMS or to IFTA software (TruckBytes, IFTA Plus, etc.).

## Cash advance / money codes

When a driver needs cash (lumper fees, scale tickets, lodging), the dispatcher issues a "money code" or "Comchek" against the card. Driver redeems at any participating location.

| Money code use | Typical amount | Fee |
|---|---|---|
| Lumper service | $50–$300 | $1–$3 |
| Scale ticket | $10–$25 | $1 |
| Lodging | $80–$120 | $1–$3 |
| Emergency repair | $50–$500 | $1–$5 |

Money codes flow into accounting as a driver advance — reconciled at payroll.

## Settlement / payroll integration

Comdata/EFS export driver fuel data into payroll systems:
- Driver fuel purchases → deducted from driver settlement if driver-paid model
- Maintenance / per-stop fees → tracked against truck cost
- Cash advance → driver loan balance

For owner-operators leased on, the carrier passes fuel charges through at cost (with markup for handling — typically $0.005/gal).

## Fraud patterns to watch

| Pattern | Detection method |
|---|---|
| Driver fueling personal vehicle | VIN-tied card or gallon-limit alert |
| Multiple fills same day at different stops | Daily-volume report flag |
| Fuel + non-fuel purchase outside whitelist | Restriction policy + alert |
| Card use after driver termination | Same-day deactivation policy |
| Diesel purchased at suspicious volume vs hours driven | Reconciliation report monthly |

A weekly fuel-card variance review (gallons purchased vs miles driven × MPG) catches most fraud within 7 days.

## Card-program negotiation levers

When changing or adding a fuel-card vendor:
- **Volume commitment** → bigger discount (typically 5,000+ gal/mo unlocks tier 2)
- **Multi-stop loyalty** → stack chain loyalty programs (TA Ultra ONE, Pilot Frequent Fueler) on top of card discount
- **Roll-back** vs **fixed-discount** structure (roll-back gives 1¢ extra at premium stops)
- **Card fees** — negotiable, $4–$6/card/mo typical
- **Transaction fees** — negotiable per stop or waived entirely on volume

## Common mistakes

- Letting drivers fuel at random truck stops without card discount
- Not enforcing PIN per driver — fraud risk
- Skipping the IFTA-data export and re-keying receipts (waste)
- Using one fuel card for owner-operators that they can't see real-time — disputes
- Not deactivating card on driver termination day
- Failing to negotiate annual renewal — discounts compress over time
- Letting drivers buy non-diesel items on the card (food, showers, merchandise) blowing up reconciliation

## Where this fits in X3

X3 imports fuel-card transactions from Comdata, EFS, WEX. Each transaction is matched to truck + driver + odometer (when available) and feeds:
- IFTA quarterly report
- Per-truck MPG calculation
- Driver fuel-economy score
- Fraud detection (gallons vs miles)
- Per-load cost analysis (fuel for that trip)

Onboarding a fuel-card integration is one of the first connections a new X3 carrier makes — high-leverage data with zero driver friction.
