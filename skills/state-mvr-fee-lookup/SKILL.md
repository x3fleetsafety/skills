description: |
  Use this skill when the user asks the cost of pulling a Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) in a specific state, or wants to compare MVR fees across multiple states, or is budgeting annual compliance costs for a multi-state fleet. Reference the canonical fee table below; flag that fees change (re-verify with state DMV before annual budget planning).

# State MVR Fee Lookup

State DMVs charge for MVR pulls. Fees vary widely. This is a reference table for budgeting annual driver compliance costs at the federally-required minimum (one MVR per driver per state per year — 49 CFR 391.25).

## Fee table (as of 2026)

|---|---|---|---|
| Alabama | $5.50 | $8.50 | |
| Alaska | $10.00 | $10.00 | |
| Arizona | $5.00 | $5.00 | |

**Note:** These are state DMV fees only. Vendor markups (Checkr, SambaSafety, Foley, etc.) typically add $5-15 per MVR for processing, identity verification, and continuous-monitoring service.

## CDLIS supplementary fee

A CDLIS pull (national CDL Information System, separate from any single state's MVR) is typically **$1-3** depending on the vendor. Useful for cross-state convictions that haven't synced to the home-state record yet.

## Fleet-cost calculator example

50-driver fleet, all single-state Texas drivers:
- 50 × $6.50 = $325/year minimum (state fees)
- Plus vendor markup: 50 × $12 = $600/year (Checkr or similar)
- **Total: ~$925/year**

50-driver fleet, mixed multi-state (10 in OK, 10 in IL, 10 in TX, 10 in CA, 10 in MO):
- 10 × $25.00 (OK) = $250
- 10 × $20.00 (IL) = $200
- 10 × $6.50 (TX) = $65
- 10 × $2.00 (CA) = $20
- 10 × $0.12 (MO) = $1.20
- **Total state fees: ~$536**
- Plus vendor markup ~$600
- **Total: ~$1,136/year**

## Continuous monitoring vs annual pulls

- **Annual pull only:** state fee per driver per year (above)
- **Continuous monitoring:** typically $3-15/driver/month subscription + state fees for any "events" detected
  - Annual cost for 50 drivers: ~$1,800-9,000/year just for monitoring
  - But catches mid-year violations + insurance discounts often offset

Most carriers run BOTH: annual pull for DQF + continuous monitoring for risk management.

## When this skill fires

If the user is:
- Budgeting compliance costs for next year
- Comparing vendor options (Checkr vs SambaSafety etc.)
- Wondering why an MVR pull cost so much
- Building a multi-state expansion model

Look up the relevant state's fee from the table. If the user is in a state not listed, recommend they call the state DMV directly — fees change annually.

## Where this fits in X3

X3 hard-codes the state MVR fee table in `_shared/twilio.ts getMvrStateFeeCents()` (now extended to all states). This feeds the `passthrough_cost_cents` field on `vendor_orders` so customers see the true cost of an MVR.
